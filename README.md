# A/B Testing Metrics Notebook (Frequentist + Bayesian)  
### A Complete Tutorial for Practical Product Experimentation

This repository contains a fully worked, interactive Jupyter notebook that explains — with code, plots, and real examples — all the core metrics used in modern A/B testing. It covers both **frequentist** and **Bayesian** methodologies and shows how they differ in **practical product decision-making**.

The notebook is designed for:
- Data scientists learning or refreshing experimentation statistics  
- Product managers who want intuitive interpretations  
- Engineers building internal experimentation platforms  
- Students and researchers needing a clear end-to-end reference  
- Teams comparing Frequentist vs Bayesian approaches

## 🚀 Features

### ✔ Frequentist A/B Testing Metrics  
The notebook introduces and implements:
- Conversion rate  
- Absolute & relative lift  
- Standard errors  
- z-scores  
- p-values  
- Statistical significance  
- Confidence intervals  
- Type I & Type II errors  
- Statistical power  
- Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)  
- Sample size calculators  

### ✔ Bayesian A/B Testing Metrics  
With intuitive, practical interpretations:
- Beta–Binomial posterior updates  
- Posterior means  
- 95% credible intervals  
- Probability that Variant B is better than A  
- Posterior lift distribution  
- Bayesian vs frequentist comparisons  

### ✔ Visualizations  
The notebook includes:
- Posterior distributions for p_A and p_B  
- Posterior lift distribution  
- Frequentist confidence interval plots  
- Power curves vs sample size  
- Scenario comparison charts  

### ✔ Realistic A/B Testing Scenarios  
Three practical cases illustrate where frequentist and Bayesian conclusions differ:

1. **Small sample, moderate lift**  
2. **Large sample, tiny lift**  
3. **Borderline significance**  

For each scenario, the notebook includes:
- Metrics  
- Plots  
- Side-by-side interpretations  
- Business-oriented decision guidance
